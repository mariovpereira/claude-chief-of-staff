# Schedules — Automation Configuration for Miami AI Lab
#
# PREFERRED: Use Claude Code hooks instead of cron.
# Mario already has hooks infrastructure from the multi-agent observability setup.
# Wire commands into SessionStart hooks so they run when you actually start working.
#
# Hook-based approach (recommended):
#   - Morning briefing (/gm) → SessionStart hook (first session of the day)
#   - Triage (/triage) → Manual invocation or midday hook
#   - Weekly review (/weekly-review) → Manual, Friday afternoon
#   - Meditate (/meditate) → End of substantive sessions
#
# Cron-based approach (fallback):
#   See bottom of file for cron examples.

# Hook integration notes:
#
# Mario's existing hooks infrastructure is at:
#   ~/agentic-workspace/claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability/
#
# To wire /gm into SessionStart:
#   Add to ~/.claude/hooks.json under "SessionStart":
#   {
#     "type": "command",
#     "command": "echo 'Run /gm for morning briefing'",
#     "triggers": ["session_start"]
#   }
#
# Note: Claude Code hooks run shell commands, not slash commands directly.
# The hook can inject a reminder into additionalContext that prompts Claude
# to run /gm automatically. This is the same pattern used by the
# multi-agent observability SessionStart hook.
#
# For true automation (no human in the loop):
#   macOS: Use launchd to run `claude --command "/gm"` at 7:00am
#   See docs/setup-guide.md for examples.
